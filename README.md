# Sky-clearing-
 - In this captivating project, I embarked on a journey to harness the power of algorithms in predicting optimal weather conditions for JFK Airport. By meticulously analyzing and interpreting weather data sourced from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), I aimed to unveil patterns that lead to clear skies."

- From the outset, data integrity was paramount. Through a meticulous data cleaning process, I elevated the predictive accuracy of the algorithm. By sifting through the complexities of the dataset, I ensured that noise and inconsistencies didn't compromise the reliability of my predictions.

- By merging the worlds of meteorology and computer science, I sought to uncover the hidden relationships within the data that contribute to clear sky occurrences. The ultimate goal? Empower decision-makers at JFK Airport with accurate insights, enabling them to plan operations and enhance passenger experiences.
